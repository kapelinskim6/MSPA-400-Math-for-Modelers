Module 1

#Exercise 1: Generate a series of plotted histograms using the code.  Generate five plots using nsample values increasing 
#by powers of ten: 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000. Calculate the sample mean value and absolute difference for each plot. 
#Evaluate the changes in absolute difference and mean values as the sample size increases. When computing the sample mean value, 
#use the dictionary histogram and the ind array. The indarray needs to be centered within each subinterval. (Hint: add 0.5)

#Exercise 2: Add code to estimate the sample variance for each random sample. For simplicity, calculate the 
#sum of the following terms: histogram[k]*(ind[k]-mean)**2. In the limit as nsamples approaches infinity, for sample data 
#grouped in subintervals centered at 0.5, 1.5, ..., 8.5, 9.5, the limiting value is 8.25. Do you see convergence? Computed results 
#for Exercise 2are shownbelowalong withtwo sample plots from Exercise 1.  

#The shape of these plots will change as the sample size changes and the random numbers change. 

ind=ind+0.5
mean=0.0
for k in range(0,len(h)):
         mean=mean+histogram[k]*ind[k]

print('n= %r and the mean value= %r') %(nsamples, round(mean,3))

variance=0.0
for k in range(0,len(h)):
         variance=variance+histogram[k]*(ind[k]-mean)**2

print('\nn= %r the sample variance equals %r') %(nsamples,round(variance,3))

Module 2:  

# Exercise 1:  Refer to Lial Chapter 18 Section 18.3. Reproduce the results shown in Example 3(c).

Area with x= -0.31 equals 0.3783
Area with x= -0.88 equals 0.1894
Manually subtracting the two values gives 0.1889.

# Exercise 2:  Refer to Lial Chapter 18 Section 18.3. Reproduce the results in Example 4 part(a).The solution requires running 
# the existing code without modification. Due to the symmetry of the normal density function, this problem is equivalent to 
# finding the probability that Z <= -2.34. 

Value of the variable x for integration = -2.34
Area with x= -2.34 equals 0.0096
