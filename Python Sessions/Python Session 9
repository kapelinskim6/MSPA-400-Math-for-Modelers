Exercise
1
:
Generate a series of plotted histograms using the code.  Generate five plots using nsample 
values increasing by powers of ten
: 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000
. Calculate the sample mean 
value and absolute difference for each plot. Evaluate the changes in absolute difference and mean 
values as the sample size increases. When computing the sample mean value, use the dictionary 
histogram and the ind array. The ind
array needs to be centered within each subinterval. (Hint: add 0.5)
Exercise 2:
A
dd code to estimate the sample variance for each random sample. For simplicity, calculate 
the sum of the following terms: histogram[k]*(ind[k]
-
mean)**2. In the limit as nsamples approac
hes 
infinity, for sample data grouped in subintervals centered at 0.5, 1.5, ..., 
8.5, 9.5, the limiting value is 
8.25. Do you see convergence? 
Computed results
for Exercise 2
are shown
below
along with
two 
sample 
plots 
from Exercise 1
.  
The 
shape of these plots will change as the sample size changes and the random numbers change.
ind=ind+0.5
mean=0.0
for k in range(0,len(h)):
mean=mean+hi
stogram[k]*ind[k]
print('n= %r and the mean value= %r') %(nsamples, round(mean,3))
variance=0.0
for k in range(0,len(h)):
variance=variance+histogram[k]*(ind[k]
-
mean)**2
print('
\
nn= %r the sample variance equals %r') %(nsamples,round(variance,3))
